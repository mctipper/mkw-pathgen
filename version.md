# Versioning

Details of each version released

## v1.0.0

First 'release'. Functional and deployed.

#### v1.0.1

Fix:
Prevented Rainbow Road single-track being part of the path when VS\* mode option was selected with include single-track checked. As there were only two options 'out of' Rainbow Road, this caused a single-track Rainbow Road to occur very frequently, when the only option 'in to' Rainbow Road is Peach Staduim->Rainbow Road, adding in another 3 lap Rainbow Road immediately afterwards is duplicative (albeit 'a valid choice').

### v1.1.0

Feature:
Added randomly generated titles to generated paths. Such as 'Goomba Shoe Classic' or 'FLUDD Gauntlet'. Adjective based on the type/length of path generated.

#### v1.1.1

Feature:
Send-to-new-tab icon for generated path.

Design:

#### v1.1.2

- New mario terms for generated path naming.

Design:

- Minor changes to track icon rendering, sizing, etc.
